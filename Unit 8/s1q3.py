# Problem 3: Ivy Cutting
# You have a trailing ivy plant represented by a binary tree. You want to take a cutting to start a new plant using the rightmost vine in the plant. Given the root of the plant, return a list with the value of each node in the path from the root node to the rightmost leaf node.

# Evaluate the time complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time complexity.

        curr = curr.right
